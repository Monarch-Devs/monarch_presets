## Supported Creators
> The supported creators present in these presets have been verified by IlMelons (Monarch Development) without any economic interest but based on the behavior that these creators have had and have with me, we hope these presets improve and speed up the installation experience of the products and save you money on the script side

> If you don't see the creators of maps you use it's because the presets are based on maps that I have on my server and from creators who have made themselves available for the creation of presets and on which I can therefore make presets.
> - **If you're a creator** and you want presets for your maps contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WKtk65yBC6)
> - **If you're a server owner** and you want presets for maps of a creator ask the creator to contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WKtk65yBC6) to organize us
